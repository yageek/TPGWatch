/**
 Conditions are attached to a Procedure. Before a Procedure executes, it will
 asynchronously evaluate all of its conditions. If a condition fails, the
 Procedure cancels with an error instead of executing.

 For example:
 ```swift
 procedure.add(condition: BlockCondition {
     // procedure will cancel instead of executing if this is false
     return trueOrFalse
 })
 ```

 Conditions are evaluated after all of the Procedure's dependencies have finished.

 A Condition can also produce its own dependencies, which are executed after the
 Procedure's dependencies have finished, but _prior_ to evaluating the Condition.
 Thus, if a crucial detail must be set to satisfy the condition, it can be
 performed in its own Operation / Procedure.

 ProcedureKit has several built-in Conditions, like `BlockCondition` and
 `MutuallyExclusive<T>`. It is also easy to implement your own.

 ## Implementing a Custom Condition

 First, subclass `Condition`. Then, override `evaluate(procedure:completion:)`.
 Here is a simple example - a FalseCondition that always fails:

 ```swift
 public class FalseCondition: Condition {
     public override func evaluate(procedure: Procedure, completion: @escaping (ConditionResult) -> Void) {
        completion(.failure(ProcedureKitError.FalseCondition()))
     }
 }
 ```

 ### Calling the Completion Block

 Your `evaluate(procedure:completion:)` override *must* eventually call the
 completion block with a `ConditionResult`. (Although it may, of course, be
 called asynchronously.)

 `ConditionResult` encompasses 3 states:
 1. `.success(true)`
 2. `.success(false)`
 3. `.failure(let error: Error)`

 Generally:
 - If a Condition *succeeds*, return `.success(true)`.
 - If a Condition *fails*, return `.failure(error)` with a unique error
 defined for your Condition.

 In some situations, it can be beneficial for a Procedure to not collect an
 error if an attached condition fails. You can use `IgnoredCondition` to
 suppress the error associated with any Condition. This is generally
 preferred to returning `.success(false)` directly.
