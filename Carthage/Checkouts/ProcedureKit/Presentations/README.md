# Presentations

- June 2016, CocoaHeads Stockholm
    Daniel Thorpe spoke about _Operations_ just before WWDC, unfortunately there wasnâ€™t a video recording of this meetup.
- July 2016, Sky UK iOS Community
    Daniel Thorpe spoke about _Operations_ just after WWDC, at an internal community session at Sky (big media corp in the UK). Although the session was streamed on YouTube, no idea where that is. This talk is mostly a rehash of the CocoaHeads on, and is probably a little bit more refined. In the slides here, there are quite a few which were skipped when the talk was given, so it actually took ~ 40 minutes.
