/**
 RetryProcedure is a RepeatProcedure subclass which can be used
 to automatically retry another instance of procedure T if the
 first instance finishes with errors. It is generic over T, a
 `Procedure` subclass.

 To support effective error recovery, in addition to a (T, Delay?)
 iterator, RetryProcedure is initialized with a block. This block
 will receive failure info, in addition to the next result (if not
 nil) of the payload iterator.

 Therefore, consumers can inspect the failure info, and adjust
 the delay, or re-configure the operation before it is retried.

 To exit with the error, this block can return nil.
