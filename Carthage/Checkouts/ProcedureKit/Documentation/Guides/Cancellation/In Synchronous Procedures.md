# Handling Cancellation in Synchronous Procedures


A _synchronous_ [`Procedure`](Classes/Procedure.html) performs all its work as part of its [`execute()`](Classes/Procedure.html#/s:FC12ProcedureKit9Procedure7executeFT_T_) method, and calls [`finish()`](Classes/Procedure.html#/s:FC12ProcedureKit9Procedure6finishFT10withErrorsGSaPs5Error___T_) before returning.

- Note: ðŸ’¡ Synchronous procedures are great candidates for the use of occasional [`!isCancelled`](Classes/Procedure.html#/s:vC12ProcedureKit9Procedure11isCancelledSb) checks.

For example, consider the following example `BadFibonacci`, which shows an *anti-pattern* which generates a sequence and feeds them to a block:

```swift
// NOTE: Do not use this code. It is not responsive to cancellation.

class BadFibonacci: Procedure {

    let count: Int
    let block: (Int) -> Void
    
    init(count: Int = 10, block: @escaping (Int) -> Void) {
        self.count = count
        self.block = block
        super.init()
        name = "Bad Fibonacci"
    }
    
    override func execute() {
        guard count > 0 else { finish(); return }
        block(0)
        var result = 0
        var prevResult = 1
        for _ in 1..<count {
            let nextResult = prevResult + result
            prevResult = result
            result = nextResult
            block(nextResult)
        }
        finish()
    }
}
``` 

An instance of `BadFibonacci` can be cancelled, but it does not *_respond_* to cancellation. It will have no impact if cancelled while running. To make it respond, we need to modify the loop to periodically check [`isCancelled`](Classes/Procedure.html#/s:vC12ProcedureKit9Procedure11isCancelledSb).

```swift
class BetterFibonacci: Procedure {

    let count: Int
    let block: (Int) -> Void
    
    init(count: Int = 10, block: @escaping (Int) -> Void) {
        self.count = count
        self.block = block
        super.init()
        name = "Bad Fibonacci"
    }

    override func execute() {
        guard count > 0 else { finish(); return }
        block(0)
        var result = 0
        var prevResult = 1
        for i in 1..<count {
            if i % 2 == 0 { // no need to check `isCancelled` every time in this loop
                guard !isCancelled else {
                    // handle cancellation by finishing and returning immediately
                    finish()
                    return
                }
            }
            let nextResult = prevResult + result
            prevResult = result
            result = nextResult
            block(nextResult)
        }
        finish()
    }
}
```

The `BetterFibonacci` class checks whether it has been cancelled every 2 values in the sequence. If it has, then it finishes and returns immediately.

- Important:
  You may want to consider how frequently [`isCancelled`](Classes/Procedure.html#/s:vC12ProcedureKit9Procedure11isCancelledSb) is checked, and potentially use a throttle as shown above. Consider that each check to [`isCancelled`](Classes/Procedure.html#/s:vC12ProcedureKit9Procedure11isCancelledSb) requires a lock which can impact performance.
  
  For tight loops, say 1000 iterations in 50ms, do not check [`isCancelled`](Classes/Procedure.html#/s:vC12ProcedureKit9Procedure11isCancelledSb) more frequently than every 1000 or even 10,000 iterations. Try to determine how quickly you want the procedure to respond to cancellation, to calibrate how frequently you check for cancellation.
