/// `PendingEvent` encapsulates a reference to a future `Procedure` event, and can be used
/// to ensure that asynchronous tasks are executed to completion *before* the future event.
///
/// While a reference to the `PendingEvent` exists, the event will not occur.
///
/// You cannot instantiate your own `PendingEvent` instances - only the framework
/// itself creates and provides (in certain circumstances) PendingEvents.
///
/// A common use-case is when handling a WillExecute or WillFinish observer callback.
/// ProcedureKit will provide your observer with a `PendingExecuteEvent` or a `PendingFinishEvent`.
///
/// If you must dispatch an asynchronous task from within your observer, but want to
/// ensure that the observed `Procedure` does not execute / finish until your asynchronous task
/// completes, you can use the Pending(Execute/Finish)Event like so:
///
/// ```swift
/// procedure.addWillFinishObserver { procedure, errors, pendingFinish in
///     DispatchQueue.global().async {
///         pendingFinish.doBeforeEvent {
///             // do something asynchronous
///             // this block is guaranteed to complete before the procedure finishes
///         }
//      }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Some of the built-in `Procedure` functions take an optional "before:" parameter,
/// to which a `PendingEvent` can be directly passed. For example:
///
/// ```swift
/// procedure.addWillFinishObserver { procedure, errors, pendingFinish in
///     // produce a new operation before the procedure finishes
///     procedure.produce(BlockOperation { /* do something */ }, before: pendingFinish)
/// }
/// ```
