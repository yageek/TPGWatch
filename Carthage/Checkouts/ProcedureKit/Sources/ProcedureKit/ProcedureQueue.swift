/**
 A protocol which the `ProcedureQueue`'s delegate must conform to. The delegate is informed
 when the queue is about to add an operation/procedure, and when they finish. Because it is a
 delegate protocol, conforming types must be classes, as the queue weakly owns it.
 
 There are slight differences depending on whether an Operation subclass or a Procedure subclass
 is being added to a ProcedureQueue.
 
 For an Operation subclass, the delegate callbacks are:
 
    - procedureQueue(_:, willAddOperation:, context:)
    - procedureQueue(_:, didAddOperation:, context:)
    - procedureQueue(_:, didFinishOperation:)
 
 If you get the first, you are guaranteed* to get the other two callbacks once the Operation
 finishes (*unless you later modify the completionBlock - which is a bad idea - or your Operation
 never finishes - which is also a bad idea).
 
 For a Procedure subclass, the delegate callbacks are:
 
    - procedureQueue(_:, willAddProcedure:, context:)
    - procedureQueue(_:, didAddProcedure:, context:)
    - procedureQueue(_:, willFinishProcedure:)
    - procedureQueue(_:, didFinishProcedure:)
 
 You will (eventually) receive all 4 delegate callbacks for a Procedure (assuming it finishes).
 
 The `context` parameter provided to the will/didAdd delegate callbacks is the same `context`
 parameter that was passed into the call to `ProcedureQueue.add(operation:context:)`.
 
 For both adding and finishing, the "will" delegate will be called before the respective "did" delegate
 method. However, you should be aware of the following additional guidelines:
 
    - `willAddOperation` / `willAddProcedure` is always guaranteed to be called before any other delegate
      methods for an Operation / Procedure instance
    - `willFinishProcedure` is always guaranteed to be called before `didFinishProcedure` for a
      Procedure instance
    - No other ordering (or non-concurrency) is guaranteed
 
 Delegate callbacks may occur concurrently and on any thread.
 
 Examples:
    - It is possible for `didAddOperation` / `didAddProcedure` to be called concurrently with
    `didFinishOperation` / `will/didFinishProcedure` for an Operation / Procedure instance.
    - It is possible for `didAddOperation` to be called concurrently for two different Operation
    instances added to a ProcedureQueue simultaneously. (i.e. Once for each Operation.)
