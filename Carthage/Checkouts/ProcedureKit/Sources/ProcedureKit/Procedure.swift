/**
 Procedure is an Operation subclass. It is an abstract class which should be subclassed.

 ```swift
 import ProcedureKit

 class MyFirstProcedure: Procedure {
     override func execute() {
         guard !isCancelled else { return }
         print("Hello World")
         finish()
     }
 }

 let queue = ProcedureQueue()
 let myProcedure = MyFirstProcedure()
 queue.addOperation(myProcedure)
 ```

 The key points here are:

 1. Subclass `Procedure`
 2. Override `execute` but do not call `super.execute()`
 3. Check the `isCancelled` property before starting any work.
 4. If not cancelled, always call `finish()` after the work is done. This could be done asynchronously.
 5. Add procedures to instances of `ProcedureQueue`.

 ### Built-in Procedures

 ProcedureKit includes a number of built-in Procedure subclasses, such as `GroupProcedure`,
 `RetryProcedure`, `RepeatProcedure`. Many of these built-in subclasses can be used as-is
 (without subclassing them). See their documentation for information on what they do and
 how to utilize them.

 ### Cancellation

 Once you add a Procedure to a ProcedureQueue, the queue takes over and handles the
 scheduling of the task at some point in the future (based on dependencies, and
 qualityOfService, etc).

 If you later decide that you do not want to execute the procedure after all, you can cancel
 the procedure to prevent it from running needlessly. You do this by calling the `cancel()`
 method on the Procedure instance itself.

 Cancelling a Procedure before it has been started by the queue will cause the queue to:
    - Ignore any unfinished dependencies
    - Automatically finish the Procedure (without calling your `execute()` override)

 This helps clear the cancelled Procedure from the queue as quickly as possible. Since it
 hasn't yet started to execute, the framework can help handle this case for you.

 However, cancelling a Procedure that has already been started by the queue will *not*
 automatically stop it from executing. It is the responsibility of your Procedure subclass,
 once it has started to execute, to check its cancelled state and respond to cancellation
 by finishing as quickly as possible.

 You can implement this via two different methods:
    1. Checking `isCancelled` periodically (for example, in your `execute()` override)
    2. Adding a DidCancel observer or overriding `produceDidCancel(withErrors:)`, which will be called after your Procedure is cancelled.

 Which method you should use is likely determined by how your Procedure performs the
 bulk of its task (synchronously - in its `execute()` override - or asynchronously, for
 which a DidCancel observer may be more useful).

     The `log` property can be used as the interface to access the logger.

     ```swift

     To adjust the instance severity of the LoggerType for the

     The logger is a very simple type, and all it does beyond

     ```swift

     By default, the Logger's logger block is the same as the global

     Ability to override Procedure's built-in finishing behavior, if a
     subclass requires full control over when `finish()` is called.

     Used for GroupProcedure to implement proper .Finished state-handling
     (only finishing after all child operations have finished).

     The default behavior of Procedure is to automatically call `finish()`
     when:
     (a) the Procedure is cancelled prior to it starting
         (in which case, the Procedure will skip calling `execute()`)
     (b) when willExecuteObservers log errors

     To ensure that a Procedure subclass does not finish until the
     subclass calls `finish()`:
     call `super.init(disableAutomaticFinishing: true)` in the init.

     - Important: If `disableAutomaticFinishing == TRUE`, the subclass is
     responsible for calling `finish()` in **ALL** cases, including when the
     Procedure is cancelled.

     You can react to cancellation using a `DidCancelObserver` and/or
     checking periodically during `execute()` with something like:

     ```swift
     guard !cancelled else {
        // do any necessary clean-up
        finish()    // always call finish if automatic finishing is disabled
        return
     }
