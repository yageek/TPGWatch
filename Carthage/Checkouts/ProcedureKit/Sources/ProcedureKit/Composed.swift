/**
 A `Procedure` which can be used to compose an Operation.
 It is designed to be subclassed or used directly.

 This can be useful for wrapping an (unmodifiable / system framework) Operation subclass inside
 a `Procedure`, gaining the advantages of a `Procedure` (such as Observers).

 - note: If you can modify the Operation subclass yourself, you may be better off migrating it
 to a `Procedure` subclass. In cases where you cannot modify the Operation subclass, such as when
 it's part of another framework for which you do not have the source code, ComposedProcedure can
 be used.

 - note: CloudKitProcedure internally uses a ComposedProcedure subclass (`CKProcedure`) to wrap
 CKOperation subclasses.
